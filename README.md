###### My Favourite Sport is Cricket, India.

I like Sport Cricket is a team game. Crickters break the records almost in every tournments, which is one of the most exciting aspect of the game. I like to watch more **T-20 or One-day matches** because the excitiment lasts till last ball. Cricket can be enjoyed by the whole team and delivers a message of working as a __Team and associating with whole team,encouraging the skills of person in action__ is another reason for liking cricket. If we enjoy suspense, then __Cricket is best__.
